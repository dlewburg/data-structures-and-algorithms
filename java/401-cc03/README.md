# Insert A Value In An Array

Write a function called `BinarySearch` that takes in two parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without using any Java built-in methods, return the index of the array's element that is equal to the value of the search key or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

I followed the template for the white board that was give. I tackled each section to the best of my ability. The calculation for the Big O Time was O(n/2). I came up with this because for each iteration half of the array is being eliminated until the proper index is found.

## Solution

To run the code, the array needs to be given values and a value as function parameters when called.
