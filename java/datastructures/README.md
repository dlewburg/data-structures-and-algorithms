# Data Structures

## Linked List Insertions

Take an existing Linked List program and insert values at the end, before, or after a particular node.

### Approach & Efficiency

I modeled my code and tests behind what already existed from the previous code challenge.

### Solution

To run the code, create a new linked list and add values to value.

# Linked List Implementation

Create a Node class and a Linked List where you can insert at the Head, checks for an included value, and construct a string from the values in the list.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach was a comparison to the class notes as well as a review of lecture.
